        Some people spend hours looking at memes, deriving positive feelings back by zero action.

This is what I call the “bad” kind of motivation, the kind of motivation cynics hate.

However, this does not discredit motivation. And, in my personal experience, its value comes in one major way:

Motivation comes from building a circle of influence containing people you don’t know in real life. 

That’s one amazing thing about the internet: it can give you insight to another person’s thoughts, feelings, and mood without that person being physically present.

People often say:

“But Mike! You have Roman and GaryVee! I don’t have anyone to motivate me!!”

Well, I don’t have Andy Dufresne or Eminem or Bryan Callen in my life. In fact, I’ve never met any of those guys. But they motivate the hell out of me.

“You become the average of the 5 people closest to you” is real.

There is a reason cliches become cliches. If I’m sitting next to you at Starbucks or I’m sitting next to you in from your glowing screen, I’m influencing you.
