     Motivation, as a subject, seems to polarize people into two opposing camps.

those who “love” motivation, “need” motivation, and would be dominating life “if they could just get more” motivation.
And across a divide of film score laced pump up speeches…

those who are disgusted by motivation, discrediting it of any merit whatsoever.
Both are camps are wrong.
